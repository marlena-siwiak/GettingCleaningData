Tidy Dataset Code Book
=====

Tidy_Dataset.txt consists of four columns separated by TAB, named:

#### activity
indicates the activity type performed by a subject during examination. Possible types are "walking", "walking upstairs", "walking downstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying".

#### subject
indicates the subject id, the number between 1 and 30.

#### variable
indicates the measurement type. There are 86 different measurements of means or standard deviations included in this datasets. Measurements which names start with "t" were derived in time, "f" at the beginning indicates frequency domain signals. No prefix is for angles of two vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample (features of the form angle(*) in the original dataset). 'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. Detail description of variable types is as follows:

#### value
the value of the mean calculated for each combination of activity, subject, and variable (measurement type). The units may be probably deduced from the information in the feature_info.txt file, however, I am not a physicist and without more details provided and better features description I don't feel competent to do it.
